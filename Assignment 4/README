Assignment 4
----------------------------


Contents:

1. main.cpp -> main code file to run the assignment
2. LoadBitmap.cpp -> cpp file given to read bmp files
3. "LinksHouse" folder -> contains all the ply & bmp files needed for texture mesh and rendering
4. README (this file)
5. screenshot1.png
6. screenshot2.png
7. terminal.png
-----------------------------


Pre-requisites to run the program:

• OpenGL
• GLEW
• GLM
• LoadBitmap.cpp

* Make sure all the files in "LinksHouse" folder & LoadBitmap.cpp are in the same directory level as the main.cpp file. Else, the program will fail to find the files. 
----------------------------------------------------------

To run the program:

Assuming you have all the ply & bmp files in the same directory level as main.cpp:

g++ main.cpp -GLEW -lGL  -lglfw -o main.out
./main.out

A window will open with an inside view of a house. On the terminal window, you will also see the outputs in "terminal.png" file.
-------------------------------------------------------------


terminal.png -> outputs on the terminal when the program runs, indicating that the bmp files have been read.
screenshot1.png -> using the arrow keys on the keyboard, move the camera/view to the door and look into the house.
screenshot2.png -> simply rotate using the arrow keys on the keyboard until you see a table with some fruit.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


How the program works:

• The readPLYFile method reads the ply files to collect vertices and triangle faces coordinates. It also collects the number of vertices and faces.

• The collected data is then used in the TextureMesh class to start drawing for each furniture/object.

• Any camera changes depending on the arrow keys. You can move around in first-person view.
